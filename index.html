   <h2>Kirby</h2>
    <p class="kirbyParagraph">
      He may only be eight inches tall, but you should never underestimate this
      little pink hero. On the planet Pop Star, Kirby used his elastic body and
      his uncanny ability to absorb enemies to save Dream Land from the
      mischievous King Dedede. Since then, he’s gone on countless other
      adventures and even become a force to be reckoned with in the Super Smash
      Bros.™ fighting game series.

    <h2>Waddle Dee</h2>
    <p class="Paragraph">
      Waddle Dees are the most common inhabitants of Dream Land. While mostly
      harmless, some Waddle Dees have been known to loyally serve King Dedede.

    <h2>King Dedede</h2>
    <p class="Paragraph">
      The greedy, self-proclaimed king of Dream Land, King Dedede is Kirby’s
      “arch-frenemy”. Armed with a giant hammer, King Dedede often causes
      trouble, but sometimes helps Kirby out in a pinch.

    <h2>Meta Knight</h2>
    <p class="Paragraph">
      The mysterious swordsman is rarely seen without his iconic mask—and when
      he does lose it in battle, he runs away! He likes to test his sword
      techniques out on Kirby, but sometimes serves as an ally.
